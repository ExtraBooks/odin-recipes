    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is great when you are looking for a quick and healthy dinner that still tastes delicious. I enjoy making this since it only has a few ingredients, but isn't lacking in flavor at all!</p>
    <p>If you haven't cooked with Tofu before, don't fear! One simple trick is to remember to "press" your tofu before cooking it by taking it out of its container, wrappping it in a reusable towel, and setting a heavy weight on top of the tofu for about 30 minutes. This releases the water from the tofu and allows it to absorb more flavor when cooking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tofu</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>

        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix about 1/4 cup of soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil, and two spoons of rice vinegar. Cut the tofu into bite size pieces and add to the bowl. Set in fridge to marinate for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While tofu is marinating, begin cooking rice</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet to medium high, once it is hot, add the tofu and cook for about 12 minutes until browned and crispy. Turn tofu every few minutes </li>
        <li>Add brocolli to a microwave safe bowl, add a tablespoon of water, and microwave covered for about 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Plate the rice, add the tofu and brocolli on top, add any remaining sauce if desired</li>
