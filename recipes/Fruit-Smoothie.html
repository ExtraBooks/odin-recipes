    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very delicious and healthy drink that's great any time of day.</p>
    <p>You can make this with fresh or frozen fruit. I enjoy frozen since it makes my smoothie cold without needing to add any ice.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fresh or frozen fruit like berries, bananas, pineapple</li>
        <li>Plant based milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the fruit and milk to a blender</li>
        <li>Blend and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
